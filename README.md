# **Problem Statement**

Spend a few hours designing and implement a quoting widget that allows a salesperson to process a customer request, search available inventory, and create a quote with price and lead time estimates. Below are some suggested user stories and code to help get you started.

# **User Stories**

1. As a salesperson, I want to view customer requests (RFQs) so that I can create quotes based on their requirements.
2. As a salesperson, I want to search the available inventory based on the customer’s requested product(s) and quantity.
3. As a salesperson, I want to calculate the price for the customer’s requested product(s) based on the current inventory and its pricing.
4. As a salesperson, I want to estimate the lead time for the customer’s requested product(s) based on the current inventory and pre-configured lead time templates.
5. As a salesperson, I want to create a quote that includes the price and lead time estimates for us to send to the customer.

# **Simple Code to Implement**

1. Create classes or data structures to represent the data model
2. Implement functionality that retrieves RFQs for the salesperson to view
3. Implement search functionality that allows the salesperson to find available inventory based on the customer’s requested product(s) and quantity
4. Implement functionality to calculate the price for the customer’s requested product(s) based on the current inventory
5. Implement functionality to calculate the lead time estimate(s) for the customer’s requested product(s) based on the current inventory and lead time templates
6. Implement functionality to create a quote with the calculated price and lead time estimates for us to send to the customer.

# **Evaluation Criteria**

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Clarity and organization of your design and code
- Completeness and correctness of your data model and system architecture
- Appropriateness of design decisions, assumptions, and trade-offs
- Quality of your code, including readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices

# Final Notes

As an early stage start up, it is far more important that we ship excellent functionality to our customers than it is for that functionality to have all of the bells and whistles. Think “a mile wide and a foot deep” - we absolutely cut scope if necessary to hit our deadlines, but we are deliberate about which scope we are cutting and documenting why. We also need to build as quickly and efficiently as possible, which includes using the latest AI tools like GPT-4 and Copilot to augment our expertise. Keep this in mind as you build out your solution!
